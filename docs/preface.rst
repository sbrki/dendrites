Preface

Concept
---------------------

Dendrites aims to be a **straightfoward** and
very **easy to use** *neural network tool* for Python 3.

With its simple and intuitive API, dendrites is ideal for people who:

* want to play around with neural networks
* are just getting fammiliar with neural networks


State
---------------------

Right now, as of *version* **0.1.1**, being a simple back-propagation neural network, dendrites is more like a  *"toy"*  in the world of neural networks.


By any means, dendrites is not a production-ready library. Dendrites **isn't very performant** (yet) and feature-full (yet), and will probably never be as good
as cutting-edge libraries, such as Google's *Tensorflow.*

However, perfomance of dendrites is not being ignored either.

But all of that does not really matter since dendrites has a **kick-ass API.**
